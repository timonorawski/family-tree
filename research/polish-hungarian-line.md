## 2. Geographic & Historical Context

### Podwilk and the Orawa (Orava) Region

- **Podwilk** is a village in Jabłonka commune, Nowy Targ County, Lesser Poland (Małopolska)
- Located in the **Polish Orawa** region, right on the Polish-Slovak border in the Carpathian mountains
- Settled in the late 16th century as part of **Wallachian colonization** of the upper Carpathians
- Major sheep-herding village — 4,000+ sheep documented by the 1600s
- Belonged to the **Thurzo family** during the Austro-Hungarian period
- 1659 census: 955 Catholics, 13 Lutherans
- 1728: 1,690 inhabitants
- 1878: 2,147 Catholics in the parish
- Has a cholera cemetery with Diveky family burials (1816, 1823)

### Critical Historical Border Changes

The Orawa/Orava region was historically part of the **Kingdom of Hungary** for centuries:

- **Before 1776:** Parish records under the **Archdiocese of Esztergom** (Ostrzyhom)
- **1776:** Diocese of Spiš (Spisz) carved out of Esztergom — Podwilk transferred to Spiš
- **1895:** Hungarian civil registration begins — parallel to church records
- **Before 1920:** Entire Orava region administered as **Árva County, Hungary**
- **1920 (Treaty of Trianon):** Orava split:
  - Majority (southern/central) → Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia) — Dolný Kubín, Námestovo, Trstená districts
  - Northeastern strip → Poland — Jabłonka, Lipnica Wielka, Orawka, Zubrzyca, Chyżne, Podwilk
- **Post-1920:** Polish civil administration, Archdiocese of Kraków

**CONFIRMED:** The citizenship validation process found records for Jan Cieluch in Hungary. He was genuinely from the Hungarian side — likely from Hungarian-administered Orava (Árva County) before the 1920 border changes.

### Parish of Saint Martin, Podwilk

- **Established:** October 18, 1687
- **Denomination:** Roman Catholic
- **Patron:** Saint Martin
- **Original diocese:** Esztergom (Ostrzyhom)
- **From 1776:** Diocese of Spiš (Spisz)
- **1715:** Original wooden church consecrated
- **1767:** Stone church built (replacement)
- **Originally covered:** Zubrzyca Górna (until 1787), Bukowina-Podszkla (until 1803), Podsarnia and Harkabuza (until 2006)
- **WARNING:** Parish registers were reportedly **taken to Slovakia in 1945** by Fr. Paweł Sopko. If true, the pre-1945 church records may be in the Spiš Diocesan Archive, not in Poland.

## 3. Surname Analysis

### Cieluch

**Confidence: HIGH** (multiple database sources agree)

- **Forebears.io:** ~1,784 bearers globally. 85% in Poland (1,506 people)
- **Geneanet:** 402 entries indexed, 316 in family trees
  - Poland: 222 | France: 46 | Germany: 38 | USA: 8 | **Slovakia: 6** | **Hungary: 2**
  - The **2 Hungary entries and 6 Slovakia entries** may relate to our family
- **Geographic concentration in Poland:** Overwhelmingly **Wielkopolska (Greater Poland)**, NOT Orawa
  - Borzecice/Walków: 51 entries | Walków: 40 | Koźmin Wielkopolski: 13 | Ostrów Wielkopolski area
- **Namespedia:** 336 occurrences across 9 countries
- **Meaning:** Unknown / undocumented
- **Notable Geneanet profiles (NOT our family):**
  - Jan N Cieluch (1894–1956), Lubaczów/Galicia → Michigan — different Jan
  - Thaddeus Francis Cieluch (1916–1996), Fall River/Detroit
  - Antoni Cieluch (1875–1928), Mogiła → Chicago
- **Wikipedia Jan Cieluch (Q14917936):** Polish politician from Gorlice County, Galicia (1866–1956) — NOT our Jan

**Key implication:** The Cieluch surname clusters 300 km north of Orawa. Jan was confirmed from Hungary. This suggests either internal migration or a small undocumented Orava branch. The 2 Hungary + 6 Slovakia Geneanet entries are critical to investigate.

### Duda — GOOD FIT

**Confidence: HIGH**

- **Etymology:** From "duda" = bagpipe/bagpipe player
- **Origin:** Brought to Polish via **Wallachian shepherds** who colonized the Carpathian mountains
- **Geneanet:** 33,556 entries total (very common surname). No specific Podwilk matches found yet.
- A Duda family in Podwilk is historically very consistent with the settlement patterns

### Zmora — VERY RARE

**Confidence: MEDIUM**

- **Etymology:** From Polish "zmora" = nightmare demon from Slavic folklore (related to Mara/Marzanna, goddess of winter and death). As a surname, likely a nickname for someone with a frightening appearance or nocturnal habits.
- **Forebears.io:** Only **311 bearers in Poland** (1 in 122,215). ~597 globally.
- Also found in USA (92), Brazil (75), France (18)
- **The extreme rarity makes it a useful research marker** — any Zmora in the Nowy Targ area is very likely related
- Need to check [mapanazwisk.eu](https://www.mapanazwisk.eu/en/ZMORA.html) for regional distribution within Poland

### Skiciak — EXTREMELY RARE

**Confidence: LOW — NEARLY UNTRACEABLE**

- **Forebears.io:** Only **11 bearers globally, all in Poland**. Ranked 5,812,366th.
- No results in Geneanet, Namespedia, FamilySearch, or any Hungarian database
- Not found in Hungarian databases — appears Polish rather than Hungarian
- Phonetically similar surnames: Skicak, Skiczak, Szkuciak
- The "-iak" suffix is common in Polish Carpathian/highland surnames
- **Needs verification against original citizenship documents**

### Orawski (adopted name)

**Confidence: HIGH**

- Directly derived from "Orawa" + "-ski" (locative suffix) = "of/from Orawa"
- **Forebears.io:** ~597 bearers globally. Poland: 472 | Germany: 56 | **Canada: 26** | USA: 14
- The **26 Canadian bearers** represent the family and extended relatives
- **CONFIRMED:** Name change happened in Canada, after most of Walter's siblings were born (post ~1943)

## 4. CRITICAL FINDING: Where Are the Records?

### The records are NOT where you'd expect

The single most important finding from deep research: **Árva County records are held in SLOVAKIA, not Hungary.**

The Hungarian National Archives (MNL) in Budapest explicitly state they only hold records from *present-day* Hungarian territory. For territories ceded after Trianon, they advise contacting **Slovak archives**.

## 5. BONUS FINDING: Potential Relative in Leamington, Ontario

### Mike Basil Orawski (d. December 10, 2011)

- **Age at death:** 90 (born ~1921)
- **Location:** Leamington, Ontario
- **Wife:** Lucie Orawski (d. November 10, 2011 — one month before Mike)
- **Children:** Aline Rocks (Gerry Rivest), Dan Orawski (Diane), Dorothy Nawrocki (Bernie), Bill Orawski (Laura Lucier)
- **Grandchildren:** Mark Rocks, Scott Rocks, Michael Orawski, Rachael Orawski, Matthew Orawski, Brandon Nawrocki, Brent Nawrocki, Mackenzie Orawski, Alexandra Orawski
- **Church:** St. John de Brébeuf, Kingsville (Roman Catholic)
- **Source:** [Reid Funeral Home obituary](https://leamington.reidfuneralhome.ca/tribute/details/521/Mike-Orawski/obituary.html)

**Analysis:** Mike Basil was born ~1921, making him 11 years younger than Eugeniusz (b. 1910). The Leamington/Windsor-Essex area and Catholic affiliation are consistent. However, **Jan and Maria may never have come to Canada** — it was Eugeniusz and Genevieve who emigrated and changed the name. So Mike Basil could be:
- An **unrelated Orawski** from the same Orava region (there are 472 Orawski bearers in Poland)
- A relative through a different connection
- Worth investigating but not necessarily family

## 7. Open Questions

1. ~~**When did the Cieluch → Orawski name change happen?**~~ **ANSWERED:** In Canada, after most of Walter's siblings were born (post ~1943). Name change record has been found and retrieved — copy pending.

2. ~~**Where exactly was Jan Cieluch from?**~~ **PARTIALLY ANSWERED:** Citizenship validation found records in Hungary. Likely Árva County. Records are in Slovak State Archives, Bytča — not Budapest.

3. **When did Eugeniusz and Genevieve emigrate to Canada?** Jan and Maria may never have come to Canada — it was Eugeniusz and Genevieve who emigrated. Presumably ~1920–1934 given Walter's birth in 1934 (likely in Canada). Ship manifests and Ancestry's 68 Cieluch immigration records are key.

4. **Did Eugene have siblings?** Only one child currently documented for Jan & Maria. Jan & Maria likely stayed in Europe — any siblings would be in Polish/Hungarian/Slovak records.

5. **Did Genevieve have siblings?** Only one child documented for Bartlomiej & Jozefina.

6. **Is Skiciak the correct spelling?** Only 11 bearers globally. Needs verification against original documents.

7. **What documents were submitted for the Polish citizenship application?** These are the richest confirmed data source.

8. **Were the Podwilk parish registers really taken to Slovakia in 1945?** If Fr. Sopko removed them, the Spiš Diocesan Archive may hold pre-1945 baptism/marriage/death records.
