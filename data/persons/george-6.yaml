Appeared before the Bailies of Canongate c.1823 (after the general amnesty) and was served with the title Earl of Winton — a local Scottish recognition, not a full legal restoration of the forfeited peerage. Died without issue. Named Joseph Logan Thompson''s father as his heir and successor. His cousin Ann Seton married a Logan; their daughter Mary Ann Logan married Joseph Logan Thompson (ET Seton''s father).'

research:
  - description: George Seton of Bellingham's appearance before the Bailies of Canongate is documented in Joseph Logan Thompson's 1901 statement and in ET Seton's autobiography. The Bailies acknowledged the claim, but this was not equivalent to a restoration of the forfeited peerage by the Crown. George died without issue and named Joseph Logan Thompson as his heir.
