  - description: ET Seton's claimed descent from the Earls of Winton was never legally established. His father's 1901 statement provides the family narrative but acknowledges 'I have no legal evidence, at hand, of my descent from Ann Seton.' Monsignor Robert Seton concluded the title was extinct. The connection to George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (the documented common ancestor with the Keith/Turnour line) depends on the legitimacy of the 5th Earl's alleged son Charles Seton (b.1711). If the Thompson/Seton genealogy is accurate, then ET Seton and the Turnour family share the 3rd Earl of Winton as a common ancestor — making them distant cousins through the Seton Earls.

  - name: From Earls of Winton to ET Seton Park
    description: Ernest Thompson Seton grew up in Toronto after his father's shipping business failed in South Shields. He became one of the most famous naturalists and wildlife artists of his era, co-founded the Boy Scouts of America, and wrote best-selling animal stories. He legally adopted the name Seton in 1901, claiming descent from George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton — a Jacobite lord convicted of treason after the 1715 Rising. If the family genealogy is correct, ET Seton and the Turnour/Keith family share George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton (1584-1650) as a common ancestor — one line descending through the 3rd Earl's daughter Elizabeth Seton (who married the 7th Earl Marischal), the other through his grandson the 5th Earl. ET Seton Park in Toronto, where family members of the Keith/Turnour line practise archery, commemorates this connection across four centuries.
