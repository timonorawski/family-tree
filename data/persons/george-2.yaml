    description: 'George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton is the common ancestor connecting two remarkable threads. Through his daughter Elizabeth Seton (who married the 7th Earl Marischal), he is a direct ancestor of the Turnour family. Through his grandson George, 4th Earl, and great-grandson George, 5th Earl of Winton (who was convicted of treason for his role in the 1715 Jacobite Rising and had his title forfeited), the Seton name continued in disputed descent to South Shields, England. Joseph Logan Thompson — whose grandmother Ann Seton insisted on her deathbed that his line were the rightful heirs to the Earldom of Winton — emigrated to Toronto in 1866. His son, Ernest Evan Thompson, legally adopted the name Seton in 1901, becoming Ernest Thompson Seton: wildlife artist, naturalist, co-founder of the Boy Scouts of America, and the man whose legacy is commemorated in ET Seton Park in Toronto, where his descendants-in-claim and descendants-in-blood of the same 3rd Earl unknowingly cross paths.'
