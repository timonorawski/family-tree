interesting_facts: 'DISPUTED: Alleged son of George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton. Said to have been born in Bellingham, Northumberland, England in 1711. His existence and parentage are the key disputed link in the chain connecting the Earls of Winton to Ernest Thompson Seton. Official peerage records state the 5th Earl died without legitimate issue; the Thompson/Seton family maintained Charles was his son. Charles''s descendants reportedly kept records, rings, and a pedigree chart to prove their lineage.'

  - description: Charles Seton's existence as son of the 5th Earl is the single most disputed link in the ET Seton genealogy. The claim rests on family tradition and a pedigree chart, not on parish registers or legal documentation. The 5th Earl was a convicted traitor living in exile — any children might have been kept hidden for safety. But equally, the claim may have been fabricated or embellished over generations.
