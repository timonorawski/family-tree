  - name: Shillinglee Park
    description: Shillinglee is an 18th-century house and estate in West Sussex, near the Surrey border. Built in 1735, a 2,000-acre landscaped park was laid out in the 1770s with fishponds and tree planting in the style of Capability Brown. In 1766 there were 26 gardeners on staff. The house was the seat of the Earls Winterton from the creation of the title until WWII. During WWII, the house was occupied by Canadian forces who accidentally burnt it down in approximately January 1943. The irony of Canadian soldiers destroying the ancestral home of a family whose title would pass to a Canadian branch two decades later has not been lost on the family. The house was later partially rebuilt and is now a Grade II* listed building.

  - name: The Name Inheritance
    description: 'The Turnour name passed through two successive female lines before being restored. Sir Edward Turnor the Speaker (d.1676) had two sons: Edward (elder) and Arthur (younger). Arthur lived at Shillinglee but his line died out. The elder Edward''s son Charles died without male issue in 1726. The name survived through Charles''s sister Sarah Turnor, who married Francis Gee. Their daughter Sarah Gee inherited as sole heiress and married Joseph Garth. Their son Edward Garth then assumed the Turnour name by Royal Licence in 1744 on his mother''s death, reuniting name and estates.'

  - name: The Disinherited Daughter
    description: 'Sir Edward Turnor (d.1721) had at least three children: Charles, Sarah, and Mary. In his will (1717), he designated the unmarried Mary as sole heir, describing her as one ''who has never disobeyed me nor in any material matter disobliged me'' — a pointed contrast implying Sarah had done exactly that. However, Mary inherited only the Little Parndon estate (the rest consumed by debts) and died without issue. The property then passed to Sarah''s grandson Edward — the very line the father had tried to cut out.'

research:
  - description: The Turnour family traces its origins to a legal family of Suffolk origin that acquired property in Essex toward the end of the 16th century. Through six centuries, the family produced a Speaker of the House of Commons, an Earl who was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a politician who served alongside Lawrence of Arabia, and eventually migrated to Canada where the title now resides.
