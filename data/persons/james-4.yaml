    description: James McGeary was part of a major wave of Irish immigration to Simcoe County, Ontario in the mid-1800s. By 1881, the southern half of Simcoe County was 60% Irish -- the highest proportion of Irish settlers of any county in Ontario. Many Irish canal workers who had built the Erie Canal (completed 1826) headed north into Upper Canada to take up farming. Others came during and after the Great Famine (1845-1852), when approximately 100,000 Irish emigrated in 1847 alone. Bond Head, where James settled, sits on the townline between Tecumseth and West Gwillimbury Townships. The community provided services including blacksmiths, harness makers, wagon makers (James's trade), stores, inns, mills, and churches. James's wife Sarah Richardson was the daughter of fellow Irish immigrants -- her father John Richardson came from Armagh and her maternal grandparents, the Austins, came from County Armagh as well. The Thorpe family, who would later marry into the McGeary line, came from Mayo/Leitrim in western Ireland -- a different part of Ireland from the Ulster origins of the McGeary, Richardson, and Austin families.
