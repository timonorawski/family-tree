    description: According to family accounts, Donald's meteorological observations and his orchestration of pilot observation gathering were instrumental in convincing the Germans that Canada had operational radar capability when it did not. This activity during World War II, prior to his service on the Bonaventure, speaks to the broader pattern of Allied deception operations that were critical to the war effort.
