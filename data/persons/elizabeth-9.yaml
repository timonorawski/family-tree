  - description: 'Lady Elizabeth Douglas is well-documented as the wife of Robert Keith, Master of Marischal, and eldest daughter of John Douglas, 2nd Earl of Morton, and Janet Crichton. WikiTree (Douglas-1682) gives her birth c.1488 at Morton, Dumfriesshire, marriage 8 January 1506, and death after 2 May 1527 at Dunnottar. Geni.com and Familypedia confirm the same details. Her husband Robert''s date of death is disputed: some say Flodden 1513, but Scots Peerage places him alive after 5 April 1514, with death between 24 August 1524 and 22 April 1525.'
