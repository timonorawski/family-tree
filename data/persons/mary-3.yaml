Geni.com gives her death as c.1442. However, there is scholarly disagreement: some sources identify the 1st Earl''s wife as Marjorie Fraser rather than Mary Hamilton, and the Keith Clan website calls her Margaret, daughter of James, 1st Lord Hamilton. The identification should be treated with some caution.'
