Possibly a son of James McGeary (b. ~1826, Ireland, wagon maker of Bond Head) and Sarah Richardson (b. ~1824, Ireland). Grey County is adjacent to Simcoe County, which would be consistent with a McGeary from the Bondhead area. Further research needed to confirm parentage.

  - description: Ancestry.ca death records list a James Edward McGeary who died in 1904 in Grey County, Ontario. Grey County borders Simcoe County to the west, which is consistent with a McGeary from the Bondhead area of Simcoe County. However, the parentage is not confirmed -- he could be from a different McGeary family entirely. The proximity to Simcoe County and the McGeary surname make him a probable relative, but confirmation requires access to the full death record which would name his parents.
