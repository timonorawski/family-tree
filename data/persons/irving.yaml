  - description: 'FINE SURNAME ORIGIN: The surname Fine is almost certainly an anglicized spelling of the Ashkenazi Jewish surname ''Fein'' (Yiddish: fayn), derived from the German/Yiddish word meaning ''fine, elegant, refined.'' Common variants include Fein, Fain, Fajn, Feiner, Feinman, and compound surnames like Feinberg, Feinstein. The Fine family likely immigrated to Canada from Eastern Europe (Russian Empire Pale of Settlement, Poland, or Austro-Hungarian Empire) between 1900-1927, before restrictive immigration laws severely curtailed Jewish immigration. Toronto''s Jewish population grew from 3,090 in 1901 to 45,000 by 1931, mostly Polish Jewish immigrants.'
