  - description: 'CHUSID SURNAME RESEARCH (February 2026): Comprehensive research into the Chusid family line. ETYMOLOGY: Derived from Yiddish ''khusid'' meaning ''Hasid'' or from Hebrew ''chasid'' (חסיד) meaning ''pious one/devout''. The surname likely originated when Jews in the Russian Empire were required to adopt surnames (1804 Statute for the Jews). SPELLING VARIATIONS: Chusid, Khusid, Husid, Chusyd, Khuzid, Chasid, Hasid, Hosid, and Chosed are documented variants. Variations arose from transliteration of Hebrew/Yiddish sounds into different languages and local dialects. GEOGRAPHIC ORIGINS: Primarily Eastern European - Ukraine (Odessa documented), Poland, and regions of the former Russian Empire''s Pale of Settlement. Research indicates a Chusid family in Odessa, Ukraine circa 1900 with a rare mitochondrial haplogroup. GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION: ~290 bearers worldwide; 82% in Americas. USA: 257 (NY 28%, CA 13%, NJ 10%); Canada: 22. Also present in Brazil, Argentina, Bulgaria, England, Israel, Ukraine. HASIDIC CONNECTION: The surname directly references the Hasidic movement founded in 18th century Ukraine by Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (Baal Shem Tov). Bearers may descend from early Hasidic followers or those recognized for piety. By mid-19th century, majority of Ukrainian Jews were Hasidic. IMMIGRATION CONTEXT: Shirley''s parents likely immigrated 1900-1927 during the Great Migration when Jewish population in Canada grew from 17,000 to 125,000. Toronto''s Jewish community centered in ''The Ward'' then Kensington Market. Immigration slowed after 1927 restrictions and halted with 1931 PC 695 order.'
