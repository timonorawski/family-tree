interesting_facts: 'Ashkenazi Jewish. The surname ''Satov'' is almost certainly a toponymic surname derived from SATANOV (Sataniv/Satanow), a historic Jewish shtetl in Podolia, Ukraine. By 1900, approximately 3,000 Jews comprised two-thirds of Satanov''s population. Possible surname variations include: Satov, Satow, Satoff, Satovsky, Satowski, Satanow, Satanover. Lou''s parents likely immigrated during the major wave of Eastern European Jewish immigration (1880s-1920s). Toronto''s Jewish population grew from 18,237 in 1911 to 45,305 in 1931; by 1931, 80% lived in/around Kensington Market.'

  - description: 'SURNAME ORIGIN: ''Satov'' is a toponymic surname with the Slavic ''-ov'' suffix meaning ''from/of''. The most probable origin is SATANOV (Ukrainian: Sataniv, Polish: Satanow), a major Jewish shtetl in Podolia, Ukraine, on the border with Galicia. The town had Magdeburg rights from 1444 and Jews settled there from the 16th century. By 1900, ~3,000 Jews made up 2/3 of the population. The 1919-1920 pogroms in Podolia (including two in Satanov itself) and the 1921 Soviet takeover would have been major emigration push factors.'

  - description: 'IMMIGRATION TIMING: Lou was born January 15, 1922. If born in Toronto, his parents likely arrived between 1900-1921 during the peak immigration wave. Toronto''s Jewish population nearly doubled from 1911-1921. Many Eastern European Jews entered Canada through Halifax (Pier 21) rather than Ellis Island. Canadian immigration restrictions tightened after 1923.'

  - description: 'PARENTS UNKNOWN: Lou''s parents have not yet been identified. Given his 1922 birth date, they were likely born c.1890-1900 in Eastern Europe (probably Podolia/Galicia region) and immigrated to Canada between 1900-1921. Hebrew/Yiddish given names would need to be determined from synagogue or cemetery records.'
